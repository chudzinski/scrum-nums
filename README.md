## About

ScrumNums is a web app intended for use on smartphones during Scrum poker, with the capability of showing the standard estimation points card deck. My goal was to create a web based app that behaves as well on mobile devices as native applications.

The app uses touch event handlers to create custom gestures such as page slide, and CSS based transitions for all animations. ScrumNums will work on any modern browser, but I had an iPhone available during development, so I was only able to include platform specific workarounds and refinements for iOS.
